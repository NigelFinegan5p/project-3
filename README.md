<br></br>
Clubs to Hire was set up in 2010 to give golfers a real alternative with their golf travel needs.

The business model allows users to try out the new models to market and with the convenience of collecting them on arrival at your airport of choice.

So if you are going on a golfing holiday with friends or family or on business, they can save you the hassle of bringing your clubs through busy airport terminals, waiting for them at excess luggage, paying extreme carriage charges and the worry of having them stolen or damaged.

Clubs to Hire offer a variety of sets to suit all standards and tastes. They provide the latest clubs from the top golf manufacturer’s, suitable sized golf bags, friendly service and value for money.

They can arrange to deliver and collect your set from your resort/ accommodation of choice.

The Value/Price proposition is very simple, when visiting the sun-kissed fairways of Portugal, Spain and beyond to the raw beauty of an Irish Links, leave your clubs at home and enjoy the latest in golf club technology.

## Problem/Solution Fit & A Franchise opportunity

<p></p>
We have been approached by a potential franchisee to develop an in-house order system as part of their Franchise Model Evaluation.

The client has already conducted significant Market Analysis and has a very good understanding of the local market dynamics where the franchise will operate.

This involved assessing competition, market saturation, and consumer demand within the target location. A detailed market analysis helped them identify the franchise’s viability in the chosen area of Portugal and market and formulate effective marketing and operational strategies.

With a focus on internal stock controls and the ordering optimization we developed a plan with our client for a back end ordering system to assist in inventory management and subsequently financial performance.
